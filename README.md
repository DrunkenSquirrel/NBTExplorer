# NBTConverter

Hastily hacked tool to migrate player inventories from one world to another. Based on the NBTExplorer by jaquadro.
There is currently no installer available, just unzip and start NBTConverter.exe from cmd.

## System Requirements

### Windows

Windows XP or later, .NET Framework 2.0 or later.

### Linux

Untested, but since NBTExplorer is compatible with Mono 2.6 or higher the converter should work as well.

NBTExplorer is compatible with recent Mono runtimes, at least 2.6 or later.
Minimally, your system needs the `mono-core` and `mono-winforms` packages, or whatever package set is equivalent.

### Mac

There is no native Mac Version for the converter, but it should work with Mono.

The Windows version of NBTExplorer can still be used if the Mac version does not work.  You will need to install the
Mono runtime, and then run NBTExplorer with Mono from the command line.
